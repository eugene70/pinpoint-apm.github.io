**Pinpoint** is an APM \(Application Performance Management\) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java / [PHP](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-c-agent). Inspired by [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html), Pinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.
